* Support OTP releases and directory structure
* Fast deps resolving and cycles detecting
* Fast compilation
* Small codebase: 1K LOC
* DTL/YECC/LEEX/PORT/SCRIPT/APP/ERL compilation
* BEAM bundles (single-file escriptized app)
* BEAM releases (faster and smaller than RELX)
* Start/Stop/Attach
* Static files generation with node.js tools

Build
-----

```sh

And put `mad` to PATH.

Building OTP Release
--------------------

Releases are bundles made by release_handler module of sasl applications.
It has it own fat bootstripts along with erlang runtime included.
This allows you to distribute you applications with copy deploy
without Erlang prerequisite.

```sh
    $ ./mad app web sample
    $ cd sample
    $ ../mad dep com pla rel
```
